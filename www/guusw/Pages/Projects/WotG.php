<p>Together with the same team as for the <a href="#project_6" onclick="show_project1(6)">Stacking Comrades</a> project, we made this game during the Global Game Jam (GGJ) 2016 in 3 days.<br>
I was in a team together with 2 other programmers, 2 designers and 1 artist.
We joined the GGJ site at our university, NHTV in Breda. We won the 2nd place for the best game at our school, and also won the people's choice award.
After the jam, we decided that this game has potential and decided to polish it and aim for a Steam Greenlight release.</p>
<p>Most of my work on this game during the game jam consisted of testing, implementing game mechanics and implementing graphical/audio/haptic feedback. After the game jam I wrote an AI for the single player game mode. Additionally this project allowed me to work with the steamworks API's and tools in order to release a game on steam.</p>
<p>
The game is  now available on steam at <a href=http://store.steampowered.com/app/503960/>http://store.steampowered.com/app/503960/</a></br>
