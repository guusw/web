This is a simple physics system with sphere and plane collision and rolling friction. I tried to make a somewhat reusable physics component system in unity with adjustable mass and friction settings.
</p>
<p>Although it is made in Unity, it does not use any of Unity's physics system, just the triggers for collision checking.</p>
